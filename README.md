# plelp

## Description
This is a project for the UC Berkeley Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp, created by Saul Navarro, Tammam Khan, and Sam Levin. 

The goal was to create a full-stack MERN application from scratch as a finale to the bootcamp. 

The idea behind Plelp is an spinoff of Yelp, but for places. Now, instead of wondering what to do when you go to a city, you can go on Plelp and see what folks are reccomending as the fun spots to do and see. 

## Usage
As a user, you can log in to see different cities and the posts that people have made. In the future you will be able to comment on posts, and make friends with other users. All you have to do, is sign up at the heroku app. Or if you would prefer to run it locally, you can dowload the files, and after you install all the packages with "npm i" type in "npm run develop" and the concurrently package will open but both the server and client.
